KING CLAUDIUS: Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
KING CLAUDIUS: The memory be green, and that it us befitted
KING CLAUDIUS: To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
KING CLAUDIUS: To be contracted in one brow of woe,
KING CLAUDIUS: Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
KING CLAUDIUS: That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
KING CLAUDIUS: Together with remembrance of ourselves.
KING CLAUDIUS: Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
KING CLAUDIUS: The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
KING CLAUDIUS: Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
KING CLAUDIUS: With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
KING CLAUDIUS: With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
KING CLAUDIUS: In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
KING CLAUDIUS: Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
KING CLAUDIUS: Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
KING CLAUDIUS: With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
KING CLAUDIUS: Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
KING CLAUDIUS: Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
KING CLAUDIUS: Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
KING CLAUDIUS: Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
KING CLAUDIUS: Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
KING CLAUDIUS: He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
KING CLAUDIUS: Importing the surrender of those lands
KING CLAUDIUS: Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
KING CLAUDIUS: To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
KING CLAUDIUS: Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
KING CLAUDIUS: Thus much the business is: we have here writ
KING CLAUDIUS: To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
KING CLAUDIUS: Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
KING CLAUDIUS: Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
KING CLAUDIUS: His further gait herein; in that the levies,
KING CLAUDIUS: The lists and full proportions, are all made
KING CLAUDIUS: Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
KING CLAUDIUS: You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
KING CLAUDIUS: For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
KING CLAUDIUS: Giving to you no further personal power
KING CLAUDIUS: To business with the king, more than the scope
KING CLAUDIUS: Of these delated articles allow.
KING CLAUDIUS: Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND: In that and all things will we show our duty.
KING CLAUDIUS: We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
*exit VOLTIMAND
*exit CORNELIUS
KING CLAUDIUS: And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
KING CLAUDIUS: You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
KING CLAUDIUS: You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
KING CLAUDIUS: And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
KING CLAUDIUS: That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
KING CLAUDIUS: The head is not more native to the heart,
KING CLAUDIUS: The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
KING CLAUDIUS: Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
KING CLAUDIUS: What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
LAERTES: My dread lord,
LAERTES: Your leave and favour to return to France;
LAERTES: From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
LAERTES: To show my duty in your coronation,
LAERTES: Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
LAERTES: My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
LAERTES: And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
KING CLAUDIUS: Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
LORD POLONIUS: He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
LORD POLONIUS: By laboursome petition, and at last
LORD POLONIUS: Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
LORD POLONIUS: I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
KING CLAUDIUS: Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
KING CLAUDIUS: And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
KING CLAUDIUS: But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
HAMLET: [Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
KING CLAUDIUS: How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
HAMLET: Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
QUEEN GERTRUDE: Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
QUEEN GERTRUDE: And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
QUEEN GERTRUDE: Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
QUEEN GERTRUDE: Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
QUEEN GERTRUDE: Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
QUEEN GERTRUDE: Passing through nature to eternity.
HAMLET: Ay, madam, it is common.
QUEEN GERTRUDE: If it be,
QUEEN GERTRUDE: Why seems it so particular with thee?
HAMLET: Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
HAMLET: 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
HAMLET: Nor customary suits of solemn black,
HAMLET: Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
HAMLET: No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
HAMLET: Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
HAMLET: Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
HAMLET: That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
HAMLET: For they are actions that a man might play:
HAMLET: But I have that within which passeth show;
HAMLET: These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
KING CLAUDIUS: 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
KING CLAUDIUS: To give these mourning duties to your father:
KING CLAUDIUS: But, you must know, your father lost a father;
KING CLAUDIUS: That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
KING CLAUDIUS: In filial obligation for some term
KING CLAUDIUS: To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
KING CLAUDIUS: In obstinate condolement is a course
KING CLAUDIUS: Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
KING CLAUDIUS: It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
KING CLAUDIUS: A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
KING CLAUDIUS: An understanding simple and unschool'd:
KING CLAUDIUS: For what we know must be and is as common
KING CLAUDIUS: As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
KING CLAUDIUS: Why should we in our peevish opposition
KING CLAUDIUS: Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
KING CLAUDIUS: A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
KING CLAUDIUS: To reason most absurd: whose common theme
KING CLAUDIUS: Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
KING CLAUDIUS: From the first corse till he that died to-day,
KING CLAUDIUS: 'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
KING CLAUDIUS: This unprevailing woe, and think of us
KING CLAUDIUS: As of a father: for let the world take note,
KING CLAUDIUS: You are the most immediate to our throne;
KING CLAUDIUS: And with no less nobility of love
KING CLAUDIUS: Than that which dearest father bears his son,
KING CLAUDIUS: Do I impart toward you. For your intent
KING CLAUDIUS: In going back to school in Wittenberg,
KING CLAUDIUS: It is most retrograde to our desire:
KING CLAUDIUS: And we beseech you, bend you to remain
KING CLAUDIUS: Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
KING CLAUDIUS: Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
QUEEN GERTRUDE: Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet-
QUEEN GERTRUDE: I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
HAMLET: I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
KING CLAUDIUS: Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
KING CLAUDIUS: Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
KING CLAUDIUS: This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
KING CLAUDIUS: Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
KING CLAUDIUS: No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
KING CLAUDIUS: But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
KING CLAUDIUS: And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
KING CLAUDIUS: Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
*exit all but HAMLET
HAMLET: O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
HAMLET: Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
HAMLET: Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
HAMLET: His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
HAMLET: How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
HAMLET: Seem to me all the uses of this world!
HAMLET: Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
HAMLET: That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
HAMLET: Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
HAMLET: But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
HAMLET: So excellent a king; that was, to this,
HAMLET: Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
HAMLET: That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
HAMLET: Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
HAMLET: Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
HAMLET: As if increase of appetite had grown
HAMLET: By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
HAMLET: Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
HAMLET: A little month, or ere those shoes were old
HAMLET: With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
HAMLET: Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
HAMLET: O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
HAMLET: Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
HAMLET: My father's brother, but no more like my father
HAMLET: Than I to Hercules: within a month:
HAMLET: Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
HAMLET: Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
HAMLET: She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
HAMLET: With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
HAMLET: It is not nor it cannot come to good:
HAMLET: But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
*enter HORATIO
*enter MARCELLUS
*enter BERNARDO
HORATIO: Hail to your lordship!
HAMLET: I am glad to see you well-
HAMLET: Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
HORATIO: The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
HAMLET: Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
HAMLET: And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
MARCELLUS: My good lord--
HAMLET: I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
HAMLET: But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
HORATIO: A truant disposition, good my lord.
HAMLET: I would not hear your enemy say so,
HAMLET: Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
HAMLET: To make it truster of your own report
HAMLET: Against yourself- I know you are no truant.
HAMLET: But what is your affair in Elsinore?
HAMLET: We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
HORATIO: My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
HAMLET: I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
HAMLET: I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
HORATIO: Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
HAMLET: Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
HAMLET: Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
HAMLET: Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
HAMLET: Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
HAMLET: My father!--methinks I see my father.
HORATIO: Where, my lord?
HAMLET: In my mind's eye, Horatio.
HORATIO: I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
HAMLET: He was a man, take him for all in all,
HAMLET: I shall not look upon his like again.
HORATIO: My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
HAMLET: Saw? who?
HORATIO: My lord, the king your father.
HAMLET: The king my father!
HORATIO: Season your admiration for awhile
HORATIO: With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
HORATIO: Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
HORATIO: This marvel to you.
HAMLET: For God's love, let me hear.
HORATIO: Two nights together had these gentlemen,
HORATIO: Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
HORATIO: In the dead vast and middle of the night,
HORATIO: Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
HORATIO: Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
HORATIO: Appears before them, and with solemn march
HORATIO: Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
HORATIO: By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
HORATIO: Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
HORATIO: Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
HORATIO: Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
HORATIO: In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
HORATIO: And I with them the third night kept the watch;
HORATIO: Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
HORATIO: Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
HORATIO: The apparition comes- I knew your father;
HORATIO: These hands are not more like.
HAMLET: But where was this?
MARCELLUS: My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
HAMLET: Did you not speak to it?
HORATIO: My lord, I did-
HORATIO: But answer made it none- yet once methought
HORATIO: It lifted up its head and did address
HORATIO: Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
HORATIO: But even then the morning cock crew loud,
HORATIO: And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
HORATIO: And vanish'd from our sight.
HAMLET: 'Tis very strange.
HORATIO: As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
HORATIO: And we did think it writ down in our duty
HORATIO: To let you know of it.
HAMLET: Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
HAMLET: Hold you the watch to-night?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO: We do, my lord.
HAMLET: Arm'd, say you?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO: Arm'd, my lord.
HAMLET: From top to toe?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO: My lord, from head to foot.
HAMLET: Then saw you not his face?
HORATIO: O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
HAMLET: What, look'd he frowningly?
HORATIO: A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
HAMLET: Pale or red?
HORATIO: Nay, very pale.
HAMLET: And fix'd his eyes upon you?
HORATIO: Most constantly.
HAMLET: I would I had been there.
HORATIO: It would have much amazed you.
HAMLET: Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
HORATIO: While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
MARCELLUS BERNARDO: Longer, longer.
HORATIO: Not when I saw't.
HAMLET: His beard was grizzled--no?
HORATIO: It was, as I have seen it in his life,
HORATIO: A sable silver'd.
HAMLET: I will watch to-night;
HAMLET: Perchance 'twill walk again.
HORATIO: I warrant it will.
HAMLET: If it assume my noble father's person,
HAMLET: I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
HAMLET: And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
HAMLET: If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
HAMLET: Let it be tenable in your silence still;
HAMLET: And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
HAMLET: Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
HAMLET: I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
HAMLET: Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
HAMLET: I'll visit you.
All: Our duty to your honour.
HAMLET: Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
*exit all but Hamlet
HAMLET: My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
HAMLET: I doubt some foul play- would the night were come!
HAMLET: Till then sit still, my soul- foul deeds will rise,
HAMLET: Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
